# What the Heck are Object and Array Operations??

### Hi all, my name is Michael George and I am an aspiring software engineer. Although I completed a JavaScript course at a coding bootcamp in March 2019, I was forced to take some time off due to external issues and mental illness. 

### I am eager to get back into coding, but when I opened up my text editor for the first time after my extended break, I had no clue what to do or where to start. I bought a couple classes online to practice... but even that was daunting. Long story short, I have reopened a lot of my old repositories and have been reverse engineering them in an attempt to relearn what I have lost. 

### This repository is my way of teaching myself how some of these built in functions work. I have put it in to a "teaching" format, because I learn the best when I am teaching others. I believe my target audience would be those with at the very least a basic understanding of Vanilla JavaScript, but I would also love to gather a following of senior developers/programmers to help coach and point me in the right direction.

### I use a Windows operating system, and I have not found a way to run my functions in vscode. That is why you see an index.html file in each built-in method. Run liveserver from the html file, and run the functions in your console.

### This is a rough draft at this point. You will see this change over time as I grow. I imagine this growing into a data-structures and algorithms repo, as my learning extends past objects and arrays. Any feedback would be fantastic! And please, someone remind me to branch...
